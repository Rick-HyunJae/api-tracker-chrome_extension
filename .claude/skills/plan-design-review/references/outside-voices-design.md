# Design Outside Voices (parallel)

Use AskUserQuestion:
> "Want outside design voices before the detailed review? Codex evaluates against OpenAI's design hard rules + litmus checks; Claude subagent does an independent completeness review."
>
> A) Yes — run outside design voices
> B) No — proceed without

If user chooses B, skip this step and continue.

**Check Codex availability:**
```bash
command -v codex >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "CODEX_AVAILABLE" || echo "CODEX_NOT_AVAILABLE"
```

**If Codex is available**, launch both voices simultaneously:

1. **Claude design subagent** (via Agent tool):
Dispatch a subagent with this prompt:
"Read the plan file at [plan-file-path]. You are an independent senior product designer reviewing this plan. You have NOT seen any prior review. Evaluate:

1. Information hierarchy: what does the user see first, second, third? Is it right?
2. Missing states: loading, empty, error, success, partial — which are unspecified?
3. User journey: what's the emotional arc? Where does it break?
4. Specificity: does the plan describe SPECIFIC UI ("48px Söhne Bold header, #1a1a1a on white") or generic patterns ("clean modern card-based layout")?
5. What design decisions will haunt the implementer if left ambiguous?

For each finding: what's wrong, severity (critical/high/medium), and the fix."

**Error handling (all non-blocking):**
- **Auth failure:** If stderr contains "auth", "login", "unauthorized", or "API key": "Codex authentication failed. Run `codex login` to authenticate."
- **Timeout:** "Codex timed out after 5 minutes."
- **Empty response:** "Codex returned no response."
- On any Codex error: proceed with Claude subagent output only, tagged `[single-model]`.
- If Claude subagent also fails: "Outside voices unavailable — continuing with primary review."

Present Codex output under a `CODEX SAYS (design critique):` header.
Present subagent output under a `CLAUDE SUBAGENT (design completeness):` header.

**Synthesis — Litmus scorecard:**

Fill in each cell from the Codex and subagent outputs. CONFIRMED = both agree. DISAGREE = models differ. NOT SPEC'D = not enough info to evaluate.

**Pass integration (respects existing 7-pass contract):**
- Hard rejections → raised as the FIRST items in Pass 1, tagged `[HARD REJECTION]`
- Litmus DISAGREE items → raised in the relevant pass with both perspectives
- Litmus CONFIRMED failures → pre-loaded as known issues in the relevant pass
- Passes can skip discovery and go straight to fixing for pre-identified issues
